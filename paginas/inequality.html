		 <li class="motivosb"><b>Domestic and Wage Inequality</b></li>
        <p>It is worth emphasizing this inequality in the wage gap in the same area of ​​activity. There is still in society the mentality that man should be responsible for the maintenance of the house, while the woman would not have that responsibility. Paid work and activities in the public sphere are valued more than domestic housework and care. This is the basis for the sexual division of labor, in which productive and realized activities in the public sphere are understood as masculine and the work of social reproduction, especially performed in the domestic sphere, is carried out by women in an invisible and discredited way, already That, within families, men did not assume these tasks in an egalitarian way. Women still face higher rates of unemployment than men: while for them unemployment was 4.7% in 2011, for them it was 7.5% (data from the Monthly Employment Survey, IBGE, 2011).</p>

	<li class="motivosb"><b>Ethnic-racial inequality</b></li>
        <p>Black women, when compared to other segments of the population, are those who feel most insecure in all settings, even in their own homes. The fact that women have consolidated their participation in the labor market does not mean that they did not work in a paid way before. As an example, we can mention the black women working since slavery and even with the abolition continued as domestic servants and cooks, receiving low salaries. The black population is the victim of aggression to a greater extent than the white population - whether male or female.</p>
