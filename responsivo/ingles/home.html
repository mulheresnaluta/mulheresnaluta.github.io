       Violence against women and gender inequality are themes of high repercussion that need to be debated. Women (mostly) are taught from childhood to play motherhood, food and housewife, while men gain toys that stimulate the logical part. At work, women are often placed in the background because they are considered inferior, fragile, and incapable of performing the same task as a man.

       With increasing awareness (with the influence of globalization), women have been taking their place in society. It is also noticed that, in the government, there are not many women to represent their rights, but more and more they are the claim of them. There are increasing demands for equal rights between men and women and for more security in relation to abuses and other forms of violence. Feminist movements have taken over streets all over the world.

       Espírito Santo is the Brazilian state with the highest rate of violence against women, exceeding twice the national average. There are 9.4 homicides per 100,000 women. Brazil is one of the countries in the world with the highest rate of female homicides, according to the study Map of Violence. It is the seventh country with the highest rate. Every day women are demoted, humiliated and / or harassed - often - just by walking down the street. There is also fear in denouncing abuses and assaults, as the subject is often treated as if the victim were to blame. There is also the salary difference between men and women with the same training and even position, which is sometimes enormous. Violence and inequality present themselves historically in different social and cultural formations, but it is something that can and should be changed. The purpose of the page is to discuss the manifestations made to demand greater security and a greater feminine space in power, both public and private, raising awareness on the subject.
